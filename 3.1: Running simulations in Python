#This notebook covers the different operations of the NumPy array, including:

#- Creating a NumPy array

#- Picking up elements from the NumPy array

#- Operations in an array

#- Computing the frequency of occurrence of elements in an array

#- Appending elements to an array

#- Creating arrays within specific intervals

#- Iterating array elements

#- Encoding values in an array

#- Reshaping the array in different dimensions


# Create a one-dimensional array
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("One dimensional array is" , arr1)

# Create a two-dimensional array
arr2 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print("Two dimensional array is", arr2)

print("The outcome of die thrown several times is given by",values)


#Elements in a NumPy array can be accessed using indexing or slicing:

#- Indexing allows direct access to individual elements using their index positions. 

#- Slicing enables selection of a range of elements from the array.

#The first element of the array is printed by using index 0
print(arr1[0])
#The last element of the array is printed by using index -1
print(arr1[-1])

The index elements can be mentioned for a 2D array for selecting array elements
print(arr2[0,1])#prints the first row, second column of the array arr2

arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])

# Select elements from index 1 to index (4-1)
print(arr[1:4])
# Select every second element
print(arr[::2])
# Reverse the array
print(arr[::-1])


#1. What is the number of elements in the array?
dice = None
dice = np.array([1,2,1,1,6,5,1,3,4,6,1])
print("The number of elements in the array is", len(dice))

#2. Which is the second-to-last element in the array?
print("The second last element in the array is", dice[-2])

#3. Display the elements from index position 4 to the end of the array.
print("The elements from index position 4 to the end of the array are ", dice[4:])

#4. Display the elements from the 2nd position to the 7th position in the array.
print("The elements from the 2nd position to the 7th position in the array are", dice[1:7])

#5. Display the elements of the array in the reverse order.
print("The elements of the array in the reverse order are", dice[::-1])

#Operations in an array

#These mathematical operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of elements in arrays.

array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
array2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Addition
result_add = np.add(array1, array2)
print("The addition of array1 and array1 is ", result_add)

# Subtraction
result_subtract = np.subtract(array1, array2)
print("The result of array1 subtracted from array 2 is ",result_subtract)

# Multiplication
result_multiply = np.multiply(array1, array2)
print("The result of product of array1 and array2 is ",result_multiply)
# Division
result_divide = np.divide(array1, array2)
print("The result of array1 divided by array2 is ", result_divide)

#In addition to the above operations, statistical operations like sum, mean, median, mode and standard deviation can also be performed on arrays.

# Create an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Calculate mean
mean = np.mean(arr)
print("The mean value of the array is" ,mean)

# Calculate median
median = np.median(arr)
print("The median value of the array is",median)

# Calculate standard deviation
std_dev = np.std(arr)
print("The standard deviation of the array is ",std_dev)

#Calculate sum
sum = np.sum(arr)
print("The sum of the array is ",sum)

#1. Calculate the sum of each roll by adding corresponding elements from both arrays.
dice1 = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2])
dice2 = np.array([1,1,2,2,4,5,6,3,2,1])
sum = np.add(dice1, dice2)
print("The sum of each roll is", sum)

#2. Calculate the average reading for each die over the 10 rolls.
mean = np.mean(sum)
print("The average reading for each die over the 10 rolls is", mean)

#3. Determine the median of the readings for each dice1 and dice2.
median1 = np.median(dice1)
median2 = np.median(dice2)
print("The median of the readings for dice1 is", median1)
print("The median of the readings for dice2 is", median2)

#4. Multiply the readings of the two dice for each roll.
product = np.multiply(dice1, dice2)
print("The product of the readings of the two dice for each roll is", product)

#For a 2D array find out the mean for each row.
array_mean = ([2,4,6,8],[3,6,9,12])
print("The mean of each row is given by",np.mean(array_mean, axis = 1))

#Computing the frequency of occurrence of elements in an array

#The frequency of occurrence of elements can be computed using `np.unique` function.
values = np.array([1,2,1,1,6,5,1,3,4,6,1])
unique, counts = np.unique(values, return_counts=True)
dict(zip(unique, counts))

#For die 1, what is the frequency of occurrence of every element?
unique, counts = np.unique(dice1, return_counts=True)
dict(zip(unique, counts))

#You suspect that die1 is not a fair die.
#Estimate the occurrence of each element and display the output in the form of a graph to prove your view
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
unique, counts = np.unique(dice1, return_counts=True)
plt.vlines(unique, 0, counts/10,lw = 55)
plt.ylim(0, max(counts/10) * 1.06)
plt.title("Density estimation")
plt.show()

# Appending elements to an array

#The `np.append()` function allows you to add elements to the end of an array. 
#It does not modify the original array but returns a new array with the appended elements.

array3 = np.array([1,2,3])
array3 = np.append(array3, [2,4,3])
print("The appended array is ",array3)

#You throw die1 three more times and get elements [2,3,3]. What is the list of numbers thrown by die1?
die1 = np.append(dice1, [2,3,3])
print("The list of numbers thrown by die1 is", die1)

# Creating arrays within specific intervals

#Use the `np.arange()` function in NumPy to create arrays with evenly spaced values within a specified interval. 
#It is similar to Python's `built-in range()` function. However, it works with both integers and floating-point numbers and returns a NumPy array.

#The function is: `numpy.arange([start, ] stop, [step, ] dtype=None)`,

#where:

#- `start` is the starting value of the interval.

#- `stop` is the end value of the interval.

#- `step` is the spacing between values with a default of 1.

#- `dtype` is the data type of the output array.

arr_arange = np.arange(5, 10)
print("The array created is given by",arr_arange)

#List all the two-digit positive integers from 10 to 100
two_digits = np.arange(10,100)
print("The list of two-digit integers from 10 to 100 is given by",two_digits)

#How many numbers are there in the sequence S = 1,4,7,.....1005 for k?
S = np.arange(1,1006, 3)
np.shape(S)[0]

#Iterating array elements

#You can iterate over elements in a NumPy array using basic Python loops or specialised NumPy functions like `nditer()` and `ndenumerate()`. 
#Let's explore each method with examples.

arr1_iter = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

for element in arr:
    print(element)



arr2_iter = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

for row in arr2_iter:
    for element in row:
        print(element)

arr3_iter = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6],[7,8,9]])

# Iterate over each element using nditer
for element in np.nditer(arr3_iter):
    print(element)

#If both index and values are required, enumerate is used
arr2_enumerate = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

for idx, element in np.ndenumerate(arr2_enumerate):
    print(f"Index: {idx}, Value: {element}")


#Suppose you have a 2D array representing the outcomes of rolling two dice multiple times.
#Each row represents a roll, and the columns represent the outcomes of the first and second die, respectively.
#Iterate over the array and print the index and value of each outcome.
#Calculate the total sum of all dice rolls.
dice_outcomes = np.array([
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4],
    [5, 6],
    [2, 5],
    [6, 3]
])
# Initialize total sum
total_sum = 0

# Iterate over the array using ndenumerate
for idx, value in np.ndenumerate(dice_outcomes):
    print(f"Index: {idx}, Value: {value}")
    total_sum += value
print(f"Total Sum of All Dice Rolls: {total_sum}")

# Encoding values in an array

#To encode values in a NumPy array, you can use techniques like one-hot encoding or string encoding depending on the type of data and the purpose:

#- One-hot encoding is commonly used in machine learning to convert categorical data into a binary matrix.

#- To encode or decode strings, use string encoding.

genders = np.array(['Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male'])

encoded_genders = np.where(genders == 'Male', 0, 1)
# Male is encoded to 0 and Female to 1
print("Original Genders:", genders)
print("Encoded Genders:", encoded_genders)

#A coin is thrown 10 times and the output is noted in an array.
#Encode this information to a numeric array of '0' and '1'
#Use may use 'H' is 1, and 'T' is 0.
coin_throw = np.array(['H','T', 'H','H','H','T','T','T','T','H'])
encoded_coin_throw = np.where(coin_throw == 'H', 1, 0)
print("Original Coin Throw:", coin_throw)
print("Encoded Coin Throw:", encoded_coin_throw)

# Reshaping the array in different dimensions

#To reshape an array using NumPy, you can use the `np.reshape()` function. 
#This function allows you to change the shape of an array without altering its data.

arr_reshape = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

# Reshape the array into a 2D array with 2 rows and 3 columns
new_arr = arr_reshape.reshape(2, 3)

print(new_arr)

# A fair coin is tossed by two players and stored in an array.
#Each player played 3 times in a row.
#Show the  values played by each player
coins = np.array(['H','T','T','T','H','H'])
coins = coins.reshape(2,3)
print("The values for each player is stored for each row is",coins)
